# esphome-daikin-s21

ESPHome component to control Daikin indoor mini-split units using the wired
protocol available over S21 and related ports.

***Upgrade Note***: If your automatic update failed, I may have changed some
config schema. I try not to do this but this project is still evolving. Please
see the changelog below for details.

A big thanks to:
* [revk](https://codeberg.org/RevK) for work on the fantastic
  [Faikout](https://codeberg.org/RevK/ESP32-Faikout) (née Faikin) project, which
  was the primary inspiration and guide for building this ESPHome component. In
  addition, the very active and resourceful community that project has fostered
  that has decoded much of the protocol.
* [joshbenner](https://github.com/joshbenner), the original author of this
  integration. His [repository](https://github.com/joshbenner/esphome-daikin-s21)
  would be my preferred place to commit patches to avoid fragmentation, but he
  lacks the time at the moment to manage the project.
* [amzaldua](https://github.com/amzaldua) for help with multiple rounds of v3
  protocol control debugging.
* The users of this project who have contributed, tested or offered feedback.

## Recent / Breaking Changes

A short changelog of sorts, I'll keep things here where a user might encounter
breaking or significant changes, including configuration updates.

* Binary sensor changes: Removed `valve`, use unit `active` instead for the
  same info. Renamed `multizone_conflict` to `multizone_online`, inverting
  logic and changing the device class. Added `system_online` to track all units
  on a compressor. Compressor `short_cycle` device class of lock removed; this
  was showing up in the HA Security dashboard. History will be inverted and
  should be purged if it matters to you.
* Bumped minimum ESPHome version to 2026.4.0 in order to address a few issues.
  If you have an `update_interval` of 0s specified in any polling components
  (s21, climate, sensor) please change this to `never` to indicate the intent
  to not poll. My code will treat this a request to free run and publish
  updates when available. Improvements to ESPHome's scheduler mean 0s polls are
  now honoured immediately and watchdog timeouts will occur. As of today
  there's no warning or mitigation during codegen. My code will avoid these
  lockups for now but in 2026.4.1 you'll see very tight polling loops until you
  update your config, so update them now. At some point down the line I will
  remove my local mitigation and ESPHome compile time warnings will serve.
  See [15516](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/15516) and [15799](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/15799).
* ***Important***: Updated configuration schema of climate component. The
  previous `update_interval` is moved to `offset_interval`. This is the period
  where the external reference temperature sensor offset is applied to the
  internal control loop. `update_interval` now means the period at which sensor
  updates are published to the frontend. This addresses a user request to limit
  the publishing rate when the system uses noisy or precise sensors with a high
  update rate that aren't actually that interesting. Changes to other values
  (action, fan mode, etc.) will still be published immediately. It can be
  omitted for free run operation if desired.
* Added instantaneous unit power sensor.
* Fixed compressor frequency sensor scaling. Please purge your history for this
  sensor, the values will be incorrect.
* Added additional energy consumption sensors for protocol 3.20+. Renamed
  existing `power_consumption` to `energy_indoor` (briefly) to `energy`. Sorry.
  Update your YAML.
* Checksum calculation was fixed. There's a faint chance that a command or
  query that was previously NAK'd actually now works.
* Custom Silent fan mode changed to standard Quiet. Custom Automatic was also
  updated to standard Auto to work around a validation issue, which results in
  a nicer icon. Update any automations to specify these new mode settings.
* Configuration schema for the climate component (specifically the unit
  temperature range limits) has changed to organize them by mode as well as
  adding a temperature offset to be applied when commanding the unit. Update
  your configurations to the new schema (see example) if your project now fails
  to compile.

## Features

The S21 platform provides a few ESPhome component types that expose the
functionality of a Daikin unit.

**NOTE:** Daikin's support for depth of unit control varies wildly over thier
product line. Your unit could have a lot of features that are exposed via the
IR remote but offer only basic control over the S21 wired bus. There's not much
this project can do for you if this is the case. As an example, I'm unable to
enable Powerful mode on my own device. ESPHome doesn't yet offer an easy way
for the unit to dynamically enable components based on feature detection, so
your best bet at the moment is to include components you'd like to use and
remove them later if not supported. With newer features I could have more
development to do (I can't test locally), so if something should be working
based on the queries available and the protocol version of your unit don't
hesitate to reach out.

## Control

### Climate

The main control interface. Supported features:

* Setpoint temperature.
* Climate modes OFF, HEAT_COOL, COOL, HEAT, FAN_ONLY and DRY. The list is
  configurable in case your unit doesn't support them all or you otherwise want
  to restrict the ones available.
* Climate action reporting.
* Fan modes auto, quiet and 1-5.
* Swing modes off, horizontal, vertical, and both. These can also be restricted
  to a specified list.
* Optional external temperature and humidity reporting and use in an secondary
  control loop. You can use a sensor placed in your living space to get a
  better reflection of the temperature you feel.
* Optional setpoint mode (HEAT_COOL, COOL, HEAT) configuration:
  * Offset to apply to commanded value. If you find your unit adequately
    conditions your living space, Daikin's control loop will overshoot the
    setpoint. It can also not achieve the desired setpoint based on the space
    and reference sensor placement. e.g. One of my rooms is 1.0C less than the
    target temperature at a steady state so I add a +1.0C offset here.
  * Range limits for values sent to the unit. Defaults should work fine, but if
    your unit is different they can be overridden.
* Optional `setpoint_dither` (default `true`). When the ideal setpoint falls
  between the unit's 0.5C steps, the commanded value is rounded in the
  direction of change so it oscillates over the ideal value over time. Set to
  `false` to always round down instead, trading the oscillation (and its
  periodic setpoint writes while the temperature hovers around the target) for
  a steady command up to half a step below the ideal value.

Daikin's modes don't neatly fit into the discrete "preset" category modelled by
ESPHome as they function more like mode modifiers. Switches are provided for
individual control of these modifiers instead of climate presets. The only one
that's exclusive is Powerful, but I felt the interface should be uniform.

The standard Daikin control loop has a few deficiencies:
* The setpoint value has 1.0°C granularity.
* The current temperature feedback value has 0.5°C granularity.
* The current temperature sensor is located in the unit, in most cases
  a wall unit placed higher in a room. This reading doesn't always reflect
  the temperature felt by occupants. It will overshoot the setpoint to try to
  account for this (see your service manual for details).

Because of these, the climate component implements a separate loop on top of
the Daikin internal one. An external temperature sensor can be used to provide
a more accurate and precise reference and an offset applied to the internal
Daikin setpoint. The internal temperature sensor can also be used for this
functionality to drive the coarse setpoint around the more granular
temperature sensor. The rate at which this secondary loop runs can be
configured with the component update interval when using this mode. All of this
is downstream of Daikin's reported temperature precision and relatively broad
control loop hysteresis, so it's far from ideal but can compensate for a
difference in temperature between the unit and your space. Keep in mind the
unit will overshoot, so you may want to configure an offset for the mode based
on a measured reference value.

Climate publish rate was raised as a problem by a user. When external sensors
are used any change in temperature or humidity will cause the updated climate
state to be published over the network. The internal default Daikin sensor can
also flip between values when on the edge between steps. You can reduce this by
configuring an explicit temperature sensor (in the case of the internal sensor)
and then using ESPHome sensor filters in the sensor definitions themselves.
Any of the averaging filters can be used to flatten out a toggling internal
sensor and use of the delta filter can gate updates to coarser, more signficant
changes.

### Select

* LED brightness. v2+ may support this. The value may change when using IR
  remote modes that make use of the PIR sensor. If this control works for you,
  there's no need to enable the Sensor LED or Sensor Mode switches or binary
  sensors.

* Vertical swing setpoint. v2+ may support this. Preset values can be selected
  for the vertical louver, including the standard on and off for the varrying
  setting.

* Humidity setpoint. v2+ may support this. The operation of this isn't well
  understood. There may be protocol sequencing work required to maintain
  control in the desired mode. If you have an "Ururu Sarara" unit and want to
  help, please post your findings in the discussions section. For now the
  setting is sent to the unit when changed in HA and nothing else done.

### Switch

Mode toggle switches for protocol v2+. As a reminder: even if these modes are
supported by your unit, they are not necessarily supported via the S21
interface. In some cases support exists for reading the current value set by
the IR remote. If this is true for you, a parallel set of binary sensors are
offered as a read only indication. Use those instead if that's the case.
There's no point in having both the switch and corresponding binary sensor
active at the same time.

* Powerful Mode
* Comfort Mode
* Quiet Mode
* Streamer Mode
* Sensor LED (unverified)
* Sensor Mode (unverified)
* Econo Mode

In the Faikout code some units appear to select the brightness of the unit LEDs
via a combination of the motion sensor and LED bits. Let me know if this is the
case for you and I can try to implement better control.

### Number

* Demand Control (v2+, unverified). Select from 30%-100% of power output. As a
  reference point, Econo limits this to around 70%.

## Feedback

### Sensor

Sensors in ESPHome are geared more towards a periodic ADC value that can be
filtered as necessary. The values read from the Daikin unit are pre-processed
and won't normally require averaging filters and the like. The sensor component
supports a configurable update interval that will publish the current values
at a chosen rate. To make this reporting more responsive, the user can set this
value to zero and every update from the unit, interesting or not, will be
published. To reduce spam when doing this, please configure a delta filter on
your sensors and only changes will be published over the network. See the
example configuration.

* Inside temperature, usually measured at indoor air handler return.
* Outside temperature from the exchanger.
* Coil temperature of indoor air handler. These will be very similar for units
  sharing an outdoor compressor. You may only want to enable this on a single
  indoor unit to reduce UI clutter.
* Target temperature (internal setpoint, modified by special modes). This is
  not the user setpoint and not that interesting to me but may be useful for
  your automations.
* Fan speed of inside blower.
* Vertical swing angle of louver. This uses Daikin's reference frame.
* Compressor frequency of the outside exchanger.
* Humidity. Not supported on all units, can report a consistent 50% or 0% if
  not present.
* Unit's demand from outside exchanger.

v2+ protocol units may also support:

* IR counter that increments when the remote is used.
* Energy consumption of all indoor units in kWh.
* Outdoor unit capacity in indoor units.

v3.20+ protocol units may also support:

* Instantaneous unit power consumption in W. If you have a multihead system,
  sampling jitter may result in incorrect results when summed. Use as a rough
  indicator only and prefer energy consumption for your dashboard.
* Energy consumption in cooling and heating modes in kWh, including the outside
  unit's use, for this inside unit.

### Binary Sensor

Mode indicators that mirror the switches above for units and modes that don't
support setting via S21. There's no point in having both the switch and
corresponding binary sensor active at he same time.

* Powerful Mode. Can pull from unit state bitfield when the primary query is
  unsupported. See the note about the bitfield and support for it below.
* Comfort Mode
* Quiet Mode
* Streamer Mode
* Sensor LED (unverified)
* Sensor Mode (unverified)
* Econo Mode

On some units a memory location was identified that contains unit and system
state informtation. We still need to observe to see how valuable these are. I
may remove the redundant ones in the future. Not all units support these. If
you see nonsense output then we are likely reading random memory. Your debug
logs can let me blacklist your model and let others avoid this.

* Defrost
* Active (Actively controlling climate, climate action can also tell us this)
* Multizone Online (Other units are in a compressor dependent mode, useful for
  resolving conflicts affecting this unit)
* Online (In a climate controlling mode, climate mode can also tell us this)
* Short Cycle Lock (2:30-3:00 minute compressor lockout when changing activity)
* System Defrost (shadows defrost? need to wait for winter to determine this)
* System Online (Any unit is in a compressor dependent mode)

Additional binary sensors:

* Serial error. Always OK if working, this is mainly for developer use.

### Text Sensor

As always, actual support may vary.

* Model Name (v3.40+, untested)
* Software Revision (v3+)
* Software Version (v2+)

If you've read the Faikout wiki you'll see many more queries available than
what this project supports. I've added a text_sensor component to read these
raw values out for debugging and protocol decoding use, without having to add
a dedicated sensor. Normally you wouldn't need to use this, but if a value
looks interesting you can see the value change over time in Home Assistant.
I'd prefer if we use this just to confirm a query works and then add proper
support, rather than trying to interpret the string via HA. Open an issue with
details if you want a sensor or control added.

## Limitations

**NOTE:** There was a serious issue when using the Arduino framework.
If flashed OTA you may lose communication and require a physical reflashing
(annoying if your board in inside your air handler). Please stick to the
ESP-IDF PlatformIO framework for now (Arduino is an extra shim over the ESP-IDF
SDK anyways). See the framework selection in the configuration example.

* Aforementioned S21 control limitations. Your unit may support a mode but
  support for controlling over S21 may not be there. See your model's
  documentation for supported wired remotes and their feature sets to confirm.
* This code has only been tested on ESP32 pico and ESP32-S3. It compiles for
  ESP8266.
* Tested with my 4MXL36TVJU outdoor unit and CTXS07LVJU, FTXS12LVJU, FTXS15LVJU
  indoor units. These are protocol v0.
* Presence detection is limited to mode configuration. I haven't found a way to
  detect the state of the sensor and expose a motion detector sensor. If you're
  handy with electronics, the PIR sensor output can be wired to a spare GPIO
  and used that way.
* Does not interact with the indoor units schedules. Do that with HA instead.
* Higher protocol versions have limited support for their features due to the
  equipment available to me, though I'm happy to try to work with you.
* Daikin's internal R&D departments must be a bit chaotic. The latest models
  might have inferior command sets to those released years ago.

## Hardware

Please see the Faikout [wiring](https://codeberg.org/RevK/ESP32-Faikout/wiki/Wiring)
page for detailed documentation including pinouts, alternate connectors with
images. The below is just a quick reference overview.

**NOTE:** The Daikin connector's Vcc provides >5V, so if you intend to power
your board with this pin, be sure to test its output and regulate voltage
accordingly. Mine supplies 14.5V.

For communications pins, I found mine pulled up internally to 5V by the Daikin
board. I've read some users don't see this, so verify with a multimeter. You may
need to add your own external pullups or make use of a level shifting circuit.
Cheap level shifter modules are available that can make use of the provided 5V
reference to do this if you'd prefer. If you are powering your device
externally you should still connect a ground reference for the communications.
A word of warning about very cheap level shifters: a user reported intermittent
communication, probably due to bad FETs. The ESP chip is 5V tolerant, but a
passive circuit with a voltage divider on the ESP Rx side should also be
possible. Said user is using 1K/2K to bring 5V down closer to 3.3V logic levels.

The ESP8266 platform is quite limited. Since the cost of boards are in the same
ballpark, please use an ESP32 (or something with a free hardware UART). ESP8266
boards often have a USB-Serial chip wired to their only hardware UART. This
chip can interfere with the Rx pin on the microcontroller, driving it to levels
that override the open drain output mode used by the Daikin unit, making it
unable to pull the Rx line to ground and signalling responses to the ESP. If
you want to use one anyways, a user has reported lifting the pads on this chip
allows the single hardware UART to be used for communication with the unit.
ESPHome's software UART implementation isn't viable for this application as it
uses delays inside an interrupt routine. This might be accpetable at higher
baud rates, but at 1200 baud the delays become too long and the system will
watchdog out and reset. Just get an ESP32 board.

### S21 Port

On my Daikin units, the S21 port has the following pins:

1. Vref (5V) Reference for communications, not to be used for powering your
  device. Sometimes N/C.
2. TX (5V) Daikin Tx, ESPHome Rx
3. RX (5V) Daikin Rx, ESPHome Tx
4. Vcc (>5V!)
5. GND

The S21 plug is JST `EHR-5` and related header `B5B-EH-A(LF)(SN)`, though the
plug pins are at standard 2.5mm pin header widths. I was able to locate headers
and precrimped wire leads on Aliexpress for a low cost.

### S403 Port

The project has been reported to work on a unit with the S403 connecter as
This has the same communication interface with a little additional
functionality, and most importantly to note, mains voltage exposed on a pin.
Do not connect anything to pin 10. Don't populate it in your plug.

1. Vcc (>5V!)
2. JEM-A OUT (pull down = ON)
3. JEM-A IN (pull down = toggle switch)
4. TX (5V) Daikin Tx, ESPHome Rx
5. RX (5V) Daikin Rx, ESPHome Tx
6. GND
7. GND
8. N/C
9. N/C
10. ~327 VDC (Dangerous!)

Housing: JST `XAP-10V-1`
Contacts: JST `SXA-001T-P0.6`

### PCB Option 1

joshbenner uses the board designed by revk available [here](https://codeberg.org/RevK/ESP32-Faikout/src/branch/main/PCB/Faikout).
Note that revk's design includes a FET that inverts the logic levels on the
ESP's RX pin, and on newer revisions the TX pin as well. When interfacing
through a FET the RX line should be configured with a pullup. This handling
should be supported with the ESP-IDF framework and regular ESPHome invert pin
schema, see the example configuration.

### PCB Option 2

I am using ESP32-S3 mini dev boards and directly wiring communication to the
S21 port. My Daikin unit pulls the TX line up to 5V, so I've configured my pin
as open drain to work with it. The RX line relies on the ESP32's 5V tolerant
GPIO pins. For power I am using a cheap 5V -> 3.3V switching module wired into
Vcc on the dev board.

## Contributing

If you can write C++, great. Even if you're more of a YAML writer or user,
your assistance with this project would be helpful. Here are some possible
ways:

* Report your experince with different Daikin units. Turning on protocol
  debugging and getting the protocol and model detection output values would be
  the first step if you encounter issues and help me learn more about the
  output of different models. The 60s debug dump in the logs is valuable for
  documentation and support.
* Let me know how useful the binary sensor values are and which just shadow
  other sensor values.
* Tell me if there are any problems with the control code for your units. The
  supported features vary wildly so you may find control or even readout of
  features or sensors doesn't work for you. This is normal, especially for my
  v0 units. It's recommended that once you figure out what doesn't work for you
  that you just disable those controls or sensors. However if you find that
  your unit does support something via enabling protocol debugging or testing
  with debug queries then I would like to add support for it.
* Please consider documenting characteristics of your unit in the appropriate
  place in the Faikout wiki. I don't want to make an inferior copy of this
  information if possible. Please don't report issues with this component to
  them as we don't share a codebase. Some of the readout values here are not
  byteswapped if we don't otherwise use them so unknown static fields may
  appear reversed compared to that project. Please verify this when
  contributing.
* Check the discussions section on Github for things that may not be in this
  readme yet.

See existing issues, open a new one or post in the discussions section with
your findings. Thanks.

## Configuration

On multihead systems some values that come from the outdoor unit will be the
same (accounting for sampling jitter). It's recommended to use ESPHome's
subdevice feature to only configure these sensors on your "primary" ESPHome
instance as a subdevice to keep individual indoor unit representations cleaner.
See the configuration example below. This feature seems designed for the
one-to-many case, whereas this system is more of a many-to-one configuration.
Locally I have two configuration template files, one for indoor only units and
one for a single indoor unit with an outdoor unit subdevice. If I can find a
better solution I'll update the example. You can also use this feature to hide
away a bunch of stats in a subdevice and leave the primary interface clean.

When using an external temperature sensor as a room reference instead of the
internal Daikin value it's recommended to change the target_temperature step
to 0.5°C to reflect the granularity of the alternate control loop provided.
The default is 1.0°C to match Daikin's internal granularity.

Here is an example of how daikin_s21 can be used with inverted UART pins
and an RX pullup (newer Faikout PCB rev):

```yaml
uart:
  - id: s21_uart
    tx_pin:
      number: GPIO48
      inverted: true
    rx_pin:
      number: GPIO34
      inverted: true
      mode:
        input: true
        pullup: true
    baud_rate: 2400
    data_bits: 8
    parity: EVEN
    stop_bits: 2

daikin_s21:
  uart: s21_uart
```

Here's an example of ESP32 dev board using direct wiring:

```yaml
uart:
  - id: s21_uart
    tx_pin:
      number: GPIO43
      mode:
        output: true
        open_drain: true  # daikin pulls up to 5V internally
    rx_pin: GPIO44
    baud_rate: 2400
    data_bits: 8
    parity: EVEN
    stop_bits: 2

daikin_s21:
  uart: s21_uart
```
